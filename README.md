# Azbot-1C
Azbot-1C is a project to create a robot for primary school.
The code shared is an attempt to using (cascade) PID controllers to provide a control of differencial motors 
with the less error as possible. Motors have enconders (odometry)

#ver. 1.0
Two PID controllers independent from each other, one for each motor drive.
#ver. 2.0 
Add a third PID to adjust differences
#ver. 3.0 Add a IMU device
